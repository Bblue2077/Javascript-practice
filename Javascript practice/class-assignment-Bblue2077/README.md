    Press the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS
    Git clone this repo and change directories into the cloned repo
    Complete the following tasks:

Inside of job.js reate a class of `Job` with the following properties:

    name
    industry
    requiresDegree
    field
    any other relevant properties (get creative!)


The following methods:

    getName
    getFieldAndIndustry
    any other relevant methods (optional)


You must also extend the class into something of your choice. It must be relevant and make sense as the properties will have to be unique enough.


Now that you have all that set up, you must accomplish the following:

    create three different instances of the Job class
    console log any 2 methods for each instance of the class
    create an instance of the extended class
    console log 2 new methods from the extended class


Challenge (Optional)

Do the entire exercise over using functional OOP. If you already did it that way, use the ES6 way using the keyword 'class' to refactor your code. Submit both versions.


Complete all of the items, push to your repo, and submit the repo link for grading.
