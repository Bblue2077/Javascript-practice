You will create a simple function that calculates the tip of a bill from a restaurant.

Inside of tipCalc.js,

    Create a variable called bill that holds the total amount of the bill (before the tip).
    Create a function named 'calculateTip' ( It should multiply the bill variable by 20% of the total and return that value)
    - Takes in an amount as an argument, when calling the function, use the variable from above.
    Create another function called 'getBillTotal' and it should do the following things:
    - Take any amount as an argument
    - call the 'calculateTip' function
    - return the amount + the tip amount
    Console log each function and state what it is returning.

 

Example:

let billAmount = 200;
calculateTip(billAmount); // returns $40
or
calculateTip(200); // returns $40

 

Bonus!

    Find a way to round your amount returned to 2 decimal places.
